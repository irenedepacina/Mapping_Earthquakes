# Overview of this Project

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. 

To complete this project, a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website was retrieved to plot geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. The extracted data was plotted on a map with various layers based on the choice of the user.

JavaScript and the D3.js library was used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library plotted the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and presented the data on an interactive earthquake map. The map shows where the earthquakes occured, the magnitude based on a color system, and the location of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates.
